            <li>
                I wanted sIBL_GUI next stable release to be a 1.5, but since we are introducing the sIBL V2 File Format, I'm jumping the release numbers closer to 2.0.

            </li>
            <li>
                Corrected one of the most nastier Bug I encountered since I'm working on sIBL_GUI. QSetting Class seems to affect Qt Dynamic Libraries ( I'm using the Jpeg one ) in a way that was making Qjpeg not working when reading settings.
            </li>
            <li>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Added Remote Templates / Help Download with the coding of sIBL_GUI_FTP Class. You can now download Templates and the Help directly from HDRLabs FTP. Notice the FTP Code is curently not multithreaded so the interface can be a bit laggy while downloading.
            </li>
            <li>
                Added an Edit button for easier Collection Management.
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
                Reworked the Exception Code.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <span style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: 700">1.2.6</span>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Corrected a bug with Logging File not being found when opening a sIBL_GUI File / Directory Browser.
            </li>
            <li>
                Logging Level is now correctly evaluated at sIBL_GUI startup.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fixed the Code Syntax that was making the compiled sIBL_GUI Executable to crash on program exit ( Console Verbose was disabled because of this in sIBL_GUI 1.2.5 ).
            </li>
            <li>
                Refactored sIBL_GUI Settings Code using the QSettings Class.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <span style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: 700">1.2.5</span>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Refactored sIBL_GUI Logging / Verbose: Now sIBL_GUI and sIBL_Framework use Python Standard Logging. Both are using a Log file : "sIBL_GUI_LogFile.log" for sIBL_GUI and "sIBL_Framework_LogFile.log" for sIBL_Framework. Those files are deleted then created each time the softwares start. One side effect is that if you launch two instances of sIBL_GUI, they will both output Log to "sIBL_GUI_LogFile.log" file, while it will not prevent sIBL_GUI from working, both Logging will be mixed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Refactored sIBL_GUI Functions Call Trace : A Decorator is now used to trace whenever a function is called.
            </li>
            <li>
                Added a brand new GPS Map under the Collection Browser. You can now see a Marker Cloud of sIBL Locations.
            </li>
            <li>
                Interface Tweak to insert the new GPS Map.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Added "Edit In sIBLEdit" Linux Code though it seems there is maybe a bug with sIBLEdit preventing it to work.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <span style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: 700">0.9.9</span>

            </li>
            <li>
                Clicking Remove Button when multiple items were selected on same row was throwing an error, this has been fixed.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <span style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: 700">0.9.8</span>
        <ul>

        <ul>
            <li>
                sIBL_GUI behavior with corrupted sIBL Sets should be better.
            </li>
            <li>
                Started Mac Os X Code ( There is no sIBL_GUI packaged version for now ).
            </li>
            <li>
                Managed to half pack the Linux Release ( You still need to download QT Libraries, refer to the Help File - Manual ).
            </li>
            <li>
                Updated sIBL_GUI Help File - Manual.
            </li>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Bug introduced with Linux Code that prevented remote execution with Maya on Windows.
            </li>
            <li>
                Corrected a dangerous behavior introduced with Eclipse NSIS Plugin: It adds this line to the setup script : "RmDir /r /REBOOTOK $INSTDIR". That means that if you installed by mistake at the root of "Program Files/" and not in "Program Files/sIBL_GUI", everything in "Program Files/" will be deleted. sIBL_GUI - 0.9.6 For Windows and 12 October Nightly Releases are concerned !
            </li>
        </ul>
        <span style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: 700">0.9.6</span>

            </li>
            <li>
                Refactored the way sIBL_GUI is verbosing, each method/definition now output something. Using the Debug Verbose Level will slow down performances.
            </li>
            <li>
                Some Code optimisations/refactoring.
            </li>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Refined Socket Connection Code ( sIBL_GUI can now directly connect to XSI too ).
            </li>
            <li>
                Added Custom IP Adress instead of the "HardCoded" "Localhost" one ( sIBL_GUI should be able to connect through Network ).
            </li>
            <li>
                Connection Address and Port now take their Default Values from the Template.
            </li>
